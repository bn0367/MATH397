## N Body Problem

This is the current version of my N Body Problem script, as well as a few gifs to showcase the results. nbodyproblem.py is the script, requires python 3.8+.

### GIFs:

- forever.gif: showing the total paths of the bodies
- follow.gif: following one body throughout
- real.gif: the regular simulation
