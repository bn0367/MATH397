## Benjamin Newman MATH397 Portfolio

### Working files:

- [coolpattern1.eps](coolpattern1.eps)
- [coolrainbow.eps](coolrainbow.eps)
- [image.eps](image.eps)
- N Body Problem!  
-  ![3 Body Problem](nbodyproblem/output-5-bodies.gif)

### 3d stuff:

- ![nested icospheres](midterm/3d/nested_icospheres.gif)
- ![game of life](midterm/3d/gol_vacuum_gun.gif)

### WIP:

- [image2.eps](image2.eps)
- orbit.eps
- simple_orbit.eps

- all of my 3d postscript will always be WIP:
  - midterm/3d/3d.eps is the main file (i.e. the library)

### Progress log:

- 2022-02-24: Created coolpattern1, started work on image/image2
- 2022-02-25: Finished image/image2
- 2022-02-26: Started work on nbodyproblem
- 2022-02-27: Finished nbodyproblem, started on orbit + epicycloid orbit
- 2022-02-28: Generalized nbodyproblem to actually be n bodies and not 3, optimized nbodyproblem a lot
- 2022-03-01: Made nbodyproblem look cooler
- 2022-03-02: More work on nbodyproblem
- 2022-03-03: Lots of optimization on nbodyproblem (10x faster)
- 2022-03-04 through 2022-03-11: Thinking of midterm ideas [notes](midterm/midterm_notes), nbodyproblem optimization, start of work on midterm
- 2022-03-12 through 2022-03-18: More work on midterm (GOL fully working, langton's ant WIP) Fully (not really) featured 3d rendering!!
- 2022-03-19 through 2022-03-25: Work on midterm paper, more game of life patterns ***note from future me: i did the 3d renderer here***
- 2022-03-26 through 2022-04-01: Finalizing midterm paper, readding isometric view to 3d, work on changing perspective 3d to more like opengl with proper matrices
- 2022-04-02 through 2022-04-08: Researching + attempting to implement opengl-like rendering
- 2022-04-09 through 2022-04-15: More work on 3d renderer, attempt to get real 3d model imported, more work on GOL pattern importing, work on GOL "infinite" grid
- 2022-04-16 through 2022-04-22: More work on 3d renderer (still opengl stuff)
- 2022-04-23 through 2022-04-29: Implemented a brainf*** intepreter in postscript just for fun, no visualization (yet?)
- 2022-04-30 through 2022-05-06: Refactor a large portion of the 3d renderer code, final brainstorming (navier-stokes?)
- 2022-05-07 through 2022-05-13: Trying out audio stuff, markov chain maybe? Nothing works yet, also refactor GOL again
- 2022-05-14 through 2022-05-18: More thinking about final, definitely fluid simuluation, still researching methods
- 2022-05-23 through 2022-05-24/23: Work on final, decided on LBM instead of navier-stokes, working on cool visulization
